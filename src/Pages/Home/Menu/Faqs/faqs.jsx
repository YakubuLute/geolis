        <h3 className="title"> How does the process of buying land work?</h3>
        <p className="text">
          The process is easy! There are no special requirements. Just select on
          our website the property you want to reserve and click on the "Reserve
          Now" button. Once you're on the checkout page, please provide the
          information listed so we can create the documents needed to close the
          deal. Then, submit payment of the reservation fee with your credit or
          debit card. We also accept payments through Zelle, Apple Pay, and wire
          transfers with Chase and US Bank.
        </p>

          How long does it take to get the title to my property?
        </h3>
        <p className="text">
          Once the reservation is complete, we will send via email your purchase
          and sale agreement (for cash deals) or the land contract (for
          financing deals) for you to sign electronically. For cash deals, we
          require that you pay for the balance of the land within 72 hours. Once
          your property is paid in full, we will take care of recording the deed
          with the county under your name and mailing it to your physical
          address. This process takes 7â€“10 days to be completed.
        </p>
        <h3 className="title">Do I need to sign the documents in person?</h3>
        <p className="text">
          No, the county is able to record the deed electronically, so we will
          take care of contacting the county and doing the registration for you,
          and we will make sure to keep you posted on a regular basis until the
          process is completed.
        </p>
        <h3 className="title">How do I know this process is legitimate?</h3>
        <p className="text">
          We guarantee a 100% clean title and no liens or encumbrances on the
          properties we sell. We have a legal team that does a thorough title
          search to make sure your property is safe to purchase. Our sales team
          will also take care of sending you a copy of the property's title so
          you can confirm we are the legal owners of the property and a copy of
          our business registration with our business ID for your review. We
          want to make sure you feel comfortable throughout the process.
